# MATLAB_climatedata_modeling


Fooling around on a student license in MATLAB back in 2015-2016 doing the following:
1) Trying to get the average temperatures for each day of the year from monthly averages using a spline function
2) Trying to simulate real-world temperature data for a given climate based on the monthly climate averages

Am planning on replicating and refining these functionalities using a different programming language/framework than MATLAB at some future point.
